NEW!

This is the documentation for the UPR update.
The existing shaders have been updated and are now supported by the Universal Render Pipeline.


-- What is in the Pack ? -- 

36 unique melee wepon model with materials (and 5 different shaders).

All models comes with the pivot at the base of the weapon.

-- How to use this package ? --

This asset pack is very simple to use. 

Just drag and drop the prefab into your scene.

Materials can be assigned to each weapon. Each material value can be tweaked to fit your needs.

FOR THE UPR UPDATE:

Proceed as you would for any UPR based project.
Create a "Universal Render Pipeline" asset and place it in the "Poject Settings > Graphics" preferences.

IMPORTANT: If the material appears pink, you are not using the correct rendering pipeline.
